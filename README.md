### Hi there# About me
<!--
### My name is Raphael Hai Since I was a child, I was involved in marketing and sales management between people in person and by phone. And I reached the stage after 20 years of work in the field (42 years old) 
It's time to change professions and move on to programming the languages of computer science. I am currently in a learning phase and would love advice to help me grow in my new field. Happy to meet and good luck to all of us
